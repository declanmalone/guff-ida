# guff-ida
Information Dispersal Algorithm in Rust

This crate name is a placeholder.

It will include functionality for doing IDA (Information Dispersal
Algorithm) transforms on data.

It is a port/rewrite of my old Perl module `Crypt::IDA`, which is
available [from CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::IDA) or from [my
`gnetraid` repository on
github](https://github.com/declanmalone/gnetraid/tree/master/Crypt-IDA/trunk).
